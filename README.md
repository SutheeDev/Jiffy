# Jiffy

Hi There! This repository represents a mock project I made during my [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/) class called [Jiffy](https://sutheedev-jiffy.netlify.app/), a web application thoughtfully crafted by the SuperHi team. Jiffy allows you to effortlessly explore the world of GIFs, short videos, and memes. You can instantly search and enjoy various animated content with intuitive features and a clean user interface. <br><br>

### Easy Getting Started:

- When you first visit Jiffy, you'll see the placeholder in the search input, guiding you on what to do immediately.

### Keyword Search

- Type anything you want to see in GIF, short video, or meme form.

### Interactive Hints

- After typing a keyword with more than two letters, a hint will appear on the screen, helping you understand what to do next.

### Seamless Loading

- When you hit enter after typing your keyword, Jiffy displays a loading icon while randomly fetching a GIF video using the GIPHY API.

### Enjoy Unlimited GIFs

- Once the GIF is loaded, it's displayed on the screen. You can hit enter again to fetch and enjoy another GIF with the same keyword.

### Clear and Start Over
